# ðŸ§  Brain Tumor Detection
This project aims to develop a machine learning model for detecting brain tumors using MRI images. The workflow includes data collection, preprocessing, model building, and deployment on Azure for real-time detection. To enhance model performance and dataset diversity, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are used for synthetic image generation.

## Key Features:
* **Data Collection & Preprocessing:** MRI datasets are collected and preprocessed, including resizing, normalization, and augmentation techniques like denoising and contrast enhancement.

* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Detailed analysis and visualization of tumor types, sizes, and locations in the dataset.

* **Model Development:** Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are built for binary classification (tumor/no tumor).

* **Azure Integration:** The model is deployed on Azure Machine Learning for scalability and real-time tumor detection.

* **Data Augmentation with GANs:** GANs are used to generate synthetic MRI images, increasing the dataset size and improving model robustness.

* **MLOps:** MLflow is utilized to track model development and streamline the workflow.

## Deliverables:

* Cleaned and preprocessed MRI dataset.

* EDA report and visualizations.

* Initial CNN model with performance metrics.

* Deployed model on Azure.

* GAN-generated MRI images.

* Final report and presentation covering the entire project lifecycle.
